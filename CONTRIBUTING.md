## Branching Strategy

- feature/\*
  <br>A feature is an entire new section of code that adds new functionality to the library. A feature branch must not change existing functionality.
- chore/\*
  <br>A chore tends to be changing the existing features with no impacts. Such as internal error message, test cases, documentation.
- bugfix/\*
  <br>A bugfix changes a single feature set that isn't working as intended.

Use one of these branches.
